# 0x06 Cuzco's Great Adventure Flag
> 20 (OSINT)

## Challenge

Cuzco continued to learn more about Parkour; she was stronger, and she was ready to break through the barrier.

How will she do it? What will launch her from her perch in the comfy hammock? Sometimes it can be hard to make the decision to leave our comfort zone and risk the unknown - is it really worth it? But know this, there is a community here for you.

Cuzco decided that she would brave it, even though there were risks, and that she would fail sometimes. Her risk profile adjusted for this and she wandered into the world to find her Parkour class and work on 10x her skills. She knew she’d need community, balance, and fortitude to help her, so she continued her quest to find these 3 things.

She grabbed the piece of paper as soon as she left her walls. She decided that for safekeeping, since she’s going on a quest, to digitize it so that then she can download it later.

On the quest…

First, she worked on developing her community. She’d been alone in her walls, but no chinchilla can do everything alone – she could not accomplish this quest as if she were an island. When she left she had to find others and decided to work with the squirrels. She worked on getting to know her new friends by studying them on YouTube.

She wanted to make meaningful connections and help their community too. Instead of clicking connect with the first squirrel she met, she tried to get to know something about each one and find ways to discuss their commonalities. That way she could write about this when she clicked connect if she was on TreeIn or Chitter. If she was in person she tried to connect with other squirrels based on shared interests.

Who made 2 YouTube videos about squirrel obstacle courses that Cuzco used to learn more about the squirrel community (1.0 and 2.0)?
