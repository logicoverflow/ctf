## Challenge

Agent Bishop, as per our discussion over the phone I am sending you the files agent Fox left on the USB thumb drive before she was kidnapped near the central park.
We think she was close to uncovering the hideout of the group that was organizing large scale Phishing camps using our organization name. Download the files [From Here](https://github.com/logicoverflow/sans-new2cyber-ctf/blob/main/fox/0x00/fox.zip)

Note: this is a HARD one, it's meant to challenge you. If you are just starting out, we recommend **"Chinchilla Challenge New2Cyber"** challenge series, and **"Trainer"** challenge series first as they are easier to solve.
