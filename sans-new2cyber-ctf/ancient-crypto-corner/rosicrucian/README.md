## Challenge

Between 1614 and 1617, three anonymous manifestos were published, first in Germany and later throughout Europe. The manifestos caused excitement throughout Europe by declaring the existence of a secret brotherhood of alchemists and sages who were preparing to transform the arts and sciences, and religious, political, and intellectual landscapes of Europe. They released a cipher which is known to be a variation of the pigpen cipher. We have collected a chart that maps each symbol to a letter for this cipher : [Download Here](https://github.com/logicoverflow/sans-new2cyber-ctf/blob/main/ancient-crypto-corner/rosicrucian/rosicrucian_table.png)
